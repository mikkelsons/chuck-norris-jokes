# Chuck Norris Joke Generator

A simple web application built with Node.js and Express that fetches random Chuck Norris jokes from the [Chuck Norris API](https://api.chucknorris.io/). Users can view a random joke and filter jokes by category.

### N.B.
I do not claim any ownership of any of the jokes, nor do I condone the content of all the jokes. I have not personally checked all of them, but I know some are a little risqu√©. Please use at your own peril.
